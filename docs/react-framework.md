## Haven Protocol Web App
# React Framework

The React App uses a class based component structure.
Largely the code is split by platform, web, desktop (electron) and shared components.
Redux Reducers and Actions are seperated into their seperate folders.
Typescript has been used in the majority of scripts.

### Debugging
The react developer tools are a good start and allow you to find the component markup in the developer inspector, from there you can work through the code to find the component, its reducers and actions.

# Wallet communication
The React App communicates with the wallet via the web core project.
